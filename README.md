# Kanban Task Management App

## Project Overview
The **Kanban Task Management App** is a fully interactive task management web application designed to help users organize and track their workflow.

- Prioritize tasks with High, Medium, or Low priority.
- Assign **due dates** using Flatpickr.
- Drag-and-drop tasks between columns with **real-time API updates**.
- Toggle between **dark and light modes**.
- Access boards via a **responsive sidebar**.
