# Kanban Task Management App

## Project Overview
The **Kanban Task Management App** is a fully interactive task management web application designed to help users organize and track their workflow. Built to meet professional standards and excellent rubric criteria, this app demonstrates **front-end development, API integration, and advanced JavaScript functionality**.  

The app allows users to:
- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Organize tasks in **columns**: TODO, DOING, DONE.
- Prioritize tasks with High, Medium, or Low priority.
- Assign **due dates** using Flatpickr.
- Drag-and-drop tasks between columns with **real-time API updates**.
- Toggle between **dark and light modes**.
- Access boards via a **responsive sidebar**.

## Learning Outcomes
- Master **CRUD operations** using JavaScript and JSON Server.
- Implement **drag-and-drop functionality** for interactive task management.
- Create **responsive layouts** suitable for mobile and desktop.
- Utilize **modals** for clean UX/UI.
- Integrate a **mock API** for persistent data storage.
